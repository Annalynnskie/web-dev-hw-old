      <h1>The Hobbit</h1>
      <h2>By: J.R.R. Tolkien</h2>
      <h3>Published by HarperCollins Publishers in 2007</h3>
      <h2>Summary</h2>
      <p>Bilbo Baggins is a hobbit who enjoys a comfortable, unambitious life, rarely traveling any farther than his pantry or cellar. But his contentment is disturbed when the wizard Gandalf and a company of dwarves arrive on his doorstep one day to whisk him away on an adventure. They have launched a plot to raid the treasure hoard guarded by Smaug the Magnificent, a large and very dangerous dragon. Bilbo reluctantly joins their quest, unaware that on his journey to the Lonely Mountain he will encounter both a magic ring and a frightening creature known as Gollum.

      <h2>About The Text</h2>
      <p><cite>The Hobbit</cite> was first published in September 1937. Its 1951 second edition (fifth impression) contains a significantly revised portion of Chapter V, "Riddles in the Dark," which brings the story of <cite>The Hobbit</cite> more in line with its sequel, <cite>The Lord of the Rings</cite>, then in progress. Tolkien made some further revisions to the American edition published bt Ballantine Books in February 1966, and to the British third edition (sixteenth impression) published by George Allen & Unwin later that same year.<br>
       For the 1995 British hardcover edition, published by HarperCollins, the text of <cite>The Hobbit</cite> was entered into word-processing files, and a number of further corrections and errors were made. Since then, various editions of <cite>The Hobbit</cite> have been generated from that computerized text file. For the present text, that file has been compared again, line by line, with the earlier editions, and a number of further corrections have been made to present a text that, as closely as possible, represents Tolkien's final intended form.<br>
       Readers interested in details of the changes made at various times to the text of <cite>The Hobbit</cite> are referred to Appendix A, "Textual Revisional Notes,"of <cite>The Annotated Hobbit</cite> (1988), and <cite>J.R.R. Tolkien: A Descriptive Bibliography</cite> by Wayne G. Hammond, with the assistance of Douglas A. Anderson (1993).</p>
