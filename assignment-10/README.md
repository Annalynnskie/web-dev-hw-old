A system fonts are installed locally and are available to you but not necessarily to the rest of the web. They are selected usually with the intent to print. Web fonts are fonts hosted on a server and need to be loaded. These fonts you don't need installed to see. Web safe fonts are fonts available across all systems so anyone can see them and they don't need to be loaded.
It's important to have a fallback font in case the original font doesn't load/work for some reason or the font hasn't loaded yet and will load in and replace the fallback.
For this assignment I set up the main and meta elements and structured my page. After I added a few styling elements like putting all the text in a white box and then I filled in the headers and paragraphs before messing with the fonts. After the content was added I chose and added fonts and got the style I wanted. I was a little confused when I went to figure out the pseudo element stuff myself but through trial and error and changing little things here and there I more or less figured it out.
