The internet is the network connecting you to the web and the web is the pages you see when you're online.
The internet works by moving data back and forth allowing things like browsing and sharing
a directory is a catalogue for files and sometimes other directories. It stores files and things related to those files.
A version control system allows multiple people to work on any file and later merge the changes together making it quicker and easier to create 1 project with multiple people working on it at once.
