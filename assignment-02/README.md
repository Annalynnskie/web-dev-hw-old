# Assignment 2
## Anna Selinger

I decided to take this class partly because it fill a requirement for the media arts minor but also because it seemed like an interesting subject to learn. I was curious about how web design works and I'm looking forward to learning more about it and some basics of code.

I hope to learn how to properly create a basic web design and I've learned about Markdown elements and repositories already.
