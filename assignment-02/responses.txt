The internet moves binary information in the form of bits through electricity, light, and radio waves. It can also move bits in the form of packets that contain segments of information about what is being sent and is reassembled before getting to the destination. Packets sent over the internet have information of where it came from and where its going. These starting place and destination for these packets are IP addresses.
Each device connected to the internet has a unique address called an IP address. The domain name system is used by the computer to look up domain names and get the ip address to connect your computer to the right place.
cookies are what websites use to remember who you are in the form of a number that identifies you. SO next time you use that site the cookie information is sent with the get request and the server knows its a request from you and sends the appropriate info.
3 parts of a url are:the protocol, which is how the browser will communicate with the server commonly http, the domain which is the purchased name of the site and ends in things like .com, and the paths which are the instructions on how to navigate the site and its directories/subdirectories.
