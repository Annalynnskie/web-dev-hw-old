The universal selector type selects everything in the page that you are adding an style element to no matter what it's under and changes it, where the element class and id selector types only select the groups with those labels. for element if you were changing the body anything in the body would change, anything listed as the class would change using the class selector and same with the id selector. The selectors are ways to change style ranging from everything to specific areas. If you only want to change the text in a certain div you would use the id selector rather than the class selector.
I found some colors that are close to what were popular in the 80's the teal: #10e7e2 purple: #ca7cd8 red: #ff2153 and yellow: #f9eb0f seemed to pop up a lot when I was looking at colors from the 80's.
I started with the main and meta elements as usual and created the stylesheet. After that I added divs and messed around with style till I was satisfied with the outcome and then I added the text and images. It was a little tricky messing with the stylesheet and css to figure out how things effected what but trial and error helped me achieve what I wanted as well as referring to the website. I'm interested in what other ways you can position something in a page.
