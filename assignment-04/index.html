    <h1>Happiness</h1>
    <h2>Raymond Carver</h2>
  <hr />
    <p>So early it's still almost dark out.<br/>
I'm near the window with coffee,<br/>
and the usual early morning stuff<br/>
that passes for thought.<br/>
When I see the boy and his friend<br/>
walking up the road<br/>
to deliver the newspaper.<br/>
They wear caps and sweaters,<br/>
and one boy has a bag over his shoulder.<br/>
They are so happy<br/>
they aren't saying anything, these boys.<br/>
I think if they could, they would take<br/>
each other's arm.<br/>
It's early in the morning,<br/>
and they are doing this thing together.<br/>
They come on, slowly.<br/>
The sky is taking on light,<br/>
though the moon still hangs pale over the water.<br/>
Such beauty that for a minute<br/>
death and ambition, even love,<br/>
doesn't enter into this.<br/>
Happiness. It comes on<br/>
unexpectedly. And goes beyond, really,<br/>
any early morning talk about it.</p>
